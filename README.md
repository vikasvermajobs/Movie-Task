# Movie-Task

use npm i to download the dependency.
use npm start to run the project.

In this project I have static data right now, for search and add functionality.
I'm just updating the static data, to make the changes permanent, we can use apis later.
I haven't used any type of fields validations for now, but I can add that later.
Right now the complete source code is in App.js as the code was not that large.
